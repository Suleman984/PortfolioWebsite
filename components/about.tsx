            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              I am an Associate Software Engineer with a strong passion for building efficient and scalable software
              solutions. My journey began during my bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, where I explored various
              technologies and honed my skills in web and software development. During my internship, I worked on
              multiple projects, creating responsive websites and applications using React, Material UI, JavaScript,
              CSS, Kotlin, and HTML.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground">
              These experiences helped me gain hands-on expertise in frontend development,and API integration. Since
              then, I have continued expanding my knowledge, working on full-stack projects and automation workflows. My
              goal is to build high-performing, user-centric applications that solve real-world problems efficiently.
